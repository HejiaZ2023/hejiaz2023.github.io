This is Hejia Zhang, an enthusiast in computer system. Starting from 24'Fall, I'll be pursuing an MS in Computer Engineering at UCSD, California.

I was a hardware developer at Akuna Capital, developing low-latency trading system based on SystemVerilog & C++. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from Department of EE, Tsinghua University with a 10% GPA ranking. I have recently took several open source classes and finished labs including CSAPP, OS, Network & Parallel Computing.
