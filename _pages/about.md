This is Hejia Zhang, a 1st-year MS student in Computer Engineering at UCSD, California. I'm current doing [MLsys](https://mlsys-ucsd.org/) related research advised by Prof. [Jishen Zhao](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jzhao/).

My current research interests include:
1. Improving performance and efficiency of LLM coding agents;
2. LLM for better EDA design.

I was a hardware developer at Akuna Capital, developing low-latency trading system based on SystemVerilog & C++. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from Department of EE, Tsinghua University.
