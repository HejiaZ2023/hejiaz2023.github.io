This is Hejia Zhang, an enthusiast in computer system (especially MLSys). From 24'Fall, I'm going to be a MSCS/MSECE student in the US. I'm actively looking for voluntary RA opportunities & internship positions.

I was a hardware developer at Akuna Capital, developing low-latency trading system based on SystemVerilog & C++. Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from Department of EE, Tsinghua University with a 10% GPA ranking.
